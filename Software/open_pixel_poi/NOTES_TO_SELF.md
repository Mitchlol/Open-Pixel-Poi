# Dear me
Compiling for web doesn't require any code changes, however web bluetooth doesn't work on your windows desktop, so test with your phone or something else. When releasing a build make sure to update the base url at the top of the index.html in the built web folder. 


Compiling for windows requires switching to flutter_blue_plus_windows see commented out stuff.
