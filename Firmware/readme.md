#Open Pixel Poi Firmware
This is the firmware, it is an arduino project designed to be built in arduino ide v1.8.19 on windows.
It used the adafruit neo pixel library, which must be installed through the ide.

It requires the esp32 boards to be installed, I reccomend v2.0.12 as newer versions cause led glitches.
When builiding, use the XIAO_ESP32C3 board for the ports to line up. All other board settings can be default.
