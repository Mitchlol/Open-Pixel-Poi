## Extra Outer Shells

1. **Option 1:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Hex Holes](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Extras/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Hex%20Holes.3mf>)
This shell is the same as the standard hex shell, but has chamfered holes around the LEDs allowing the shell to be printed in any color of TPU.

    * **Pros** 
        * Can be printed with any color TPU
        * Crisp patten display due to lack of diffusion
        * Darker shells look cool, and are less visible in motion
    * **cons**
        * Poor visibility at angles due to lack of difusion
        * Slight gaps in pattern if the poi antispin roll while spinning at certain speeds
1. **Option 2:** [Open Pixel Poi - Shell - Round Superdiffuser](<https://github.com/Mitchlol/Open-Pixel-Poi/raw/refs/heads/main/Hardware/3D%20Printable%20Body/Extras/Open%20Pixel%20Poi%20-%20Shell%20-%20Round%20SuperDiffuser.3mf>) 
This shell is designed to try and maximize diffusion.

        <img src="superdiffuser3.jpg" alt="drawing" width="150"/>
    </div>

    * **Pros** 
        * Looks cool when sitting still
        * Softens overly pixelated patterns
    * **cons**
        * Too much diffusion, makes artwork blurry
        * Extra thick and heavy
        * Really firm/hard due to shape
