# Snap Lid Shell Page

So, uh, here is the snap in shell page. Things are still somewhat in flux. So every time you print, it's probably best to check if the files have changed. I'm calling it beta for now

Note: the snaps are pretty hard to snap in. In cold temperatures, it can be even worse. I may loosen them or make a loose version if people ask for it. But i want to leave them as is till i can see how secure they are in hot summer temperatures. Id rather they're annoying, than springing loose.

Also Note: that the lid only fits on properly in one out of the six orientations, as the tabs need to line up and there are insets to make room for the bumps on the shell stop the main module body from falling out.

I typically use a pry tool (wedge, knife, keys, etc) to get the first snap up, then pull the rest. I also use my poi knob, or a wall, table, surface or edge to smash them back in. Not exactly user friendly, but theyre very secure. 

The snap system has a bunch advanatges over the older style shells.
1. The mounting hole prints flat and directly on the print bed allowing for easy modificaion
1. You dont need to mess with your leashes to access the USB port, removing the need for slip knots
1. The sides of the holes on the old design were definitly a weak point, and so far, this seems much stronger
1. The two tabs always line up weird and stagger and its just not cool
1. The old caps were annoying to put on and slid around a lot

If you want a different mounting situation on these caps, and don't know how to model it yourself, send a message in the discord channel, and I can likely help you out (especially if you can make an engineering drawing, or something close enough).
